This project is built using the basics of spring boot v2.7.2 and is designed to run on a tomcat container on port 8080.

To start, you can simply run the com.notable.health.nhtest.NhTestApplication.java class


Thoughts/Notes

There is so much missing, full test suites, better documentation, authentication/authorization, CSRF protection, etc.
